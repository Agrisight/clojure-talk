# Hacking In Clojure

# Start Clojuring
First, make sure you have Java installed.

Then, download the leiningen script from http://leiningen.org/

You can run the trivial examples from this slideshow in a REPL `lein
repl`

To see our "complete" project, check out the repo at Farmlogs/clojure-talk.

# Brief Intro to Clojure/Lisp

* Normally, you call functions this way

```python
foo(1, 3, 4)
```
* Now, move that leftmost parenthesis a little _more_ to the left:

```clojure
(foo 1 2 3) ; that wasn't so hard!
```
* Anything of that form is called an "s-expression":

```clojure
(whatever-you-are-doing arg1 arg2 ...) ; those dots are not valid clojure
```
In lisps, (almost) everything is an s-expression...

(continued on next slide)
---
# S-Expression Examples
* Defining things

```clojure
(def message "Hello World")

(defn add-two-things 
  "Add two numbers together"
  [x y]
  (+ x y))
```

* Control "statements" (expressions)

```clojure
(if (predicate? item) 
  (do-something item) 
  (do-something-else item))

(case item
  "foo" (do-foo item)
  "bar" (do-bar item)
  (do-default item))
```
That's it!

# How to Server in Clojure: Ring
* From the [Github Page](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring)
> Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI
  and Ruby's Rack

* A Ring application is just a clojure function:

```clojure
(defn app 
  "A Ring application that greets you for every request"
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello World"})
```
* To run the app, you plug the function into some magic java
server adapter which handles the actual requesting and responsing

* Very simple, and (as we'll soon see), *very* powerful
---
# First, Higher Order Functions
* Any function that takes another function as an argument and/or
returns a function as its result

* The most well-known examples are the classic collection processing
functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc.

```clojure
(map inc [1 2 3]) ; => (2 3 4)

(filter pos? [-8 -2 1 9 3]) ; => (1 9 3)

(reduce + [1 2 3]) ; => 6
```
* function composition and partial application:

```clojure
(def filter-then-count (comp count filter))
; just like in math f(g(x)), count(filter(...))

(filter-then-count neg? [-3 -2 -1 1 2 3]) ; => 3

(def add-two (partial + 2))

(add-two 5) ; => 7

```
---
# Chaining Together Functions


Let's say we had a collection of fields, and wanted to find the total
rainfall of all fields in Michigan
```clojure
(def michigan? (comp (partial = "MI") :state))

(->> fields
     (filter michigan?)
     (map :rainfall)
     (reduce +))
```
`->>` is a macro, which we'll cover in a bit. For now you can just
     think of it as another part of Clojure syntax.
---
# Back to Ring: Middleware
Remember our simple app?
```clojure
(defn app 
  "A Ring application that greets you for every request"
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello World"})
```
"Hello World" is pretty sensitive info, so we should authenticate
every request:
```clojure
(defn get-cookie [name request] ...) ; not a valid clojure function

(defn wrap-authentication 
  "Checks every request for a valid cookie before continuing"
  [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (if (= "super-secret-session-id" (get-cookie "session" request))
        (handler request)
        {:status 403 :body "You're not allowed!"})))

(def secure-app (wrap-authentication app)) ; hooray for higher-order functions!
```
---
# More Middleware
Since middleware are just functions, and most real apps use a lot of
middlware, you can chain them together like anything else:
```clojure
(defn app [request] ...)

(def better-app
  (-> app
      (wrap-authentication)
      (wrap-json)
      (wrap-cookies)))
```
---
# Obligatory Lisp Macro Slide(s)
Lisps have a proud tradition of utilizing the power of _macros_, which
you can think of as "functions" (not technically functions) that
manipulate code at compile time instead of data at runtime.

Macros can be useful for automating routine things like setting up and
tearing down test data:
```clojure
(deftest test-database-stuff
  (with-data [person [person-model]
              pet [pet-model {:person person}]]
    (do-test-stuff person pet))))
```
As well as modifying language syntax itself
```clojure
(defn arbitrary-arithmetic [x y z]
  (/ (* 2 y) (+ z (- x y))))

; using the "$=" macro from http://incater.org
(defn arbitrary-arithmetic [x y z]
  ($= 
    (2 * y) / (z + x - y)))
```
---
# Writing Real Web Apps with Macros
For most web apps that aren't toy examples, you can use Compojure, a
set of macros for defining routes in a sane, high-level way:
```clojure
(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (POST "/data" request
        (post-some-data request))
  (GET "/data/:id" [id]
       (get-some-data id)))
```
`defroutes`, `GET` and `POST` all compile down to something like this:
```clojure
(defn app [request]
  (if (and (= (:uri request) "/") 
           (= (:request-method request) :get))
    {:status 200 :body "Hello World"}
    (if (and (= (:uri request) "/data")
             (= (:request-method request) :post))
      (post-some-data request)
      ...)))
```
Much easier than writing all of that out by hand!
---
# Testing Clojure Apps
Testing is important.

By default, all Clojure applications have access to a nice set of
macros in `clojure.test`
```clojure
(deftest security-policy

  (testing "authorized requests are allowed"
    (let [response (secure-app authed-request)]
      (is (= 200 (:status good-response)))
      (is (= "Hello World" (:body good-response)))))

  (testing "unauthorized requests are not allowed"
     (let [bad-response (secure-app bad-request)]
       (is (= 403 (:status bad-response)))
       (is (= "You're not allowed!" (:body bad-response))))))
```
Because `testing` and `is` are both macros, when the test fails, it
can tell you exactly what code failed, not just whatever was passed
into a comparison function.

# Extra Credit
We've only just scratched the surface of the wonderful world of
Clojure, there are so many other things to learn about, such as:

* [Every talk](http://thechangelog.com/rich-hickeys-greatest-hits/) by
Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure 

* [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), Clojure that runs on top of JavaScript instead of the
JVM
