# Farmlogs Clojure Talk

All material from our intro to Clojure talk.

Head over to [Try Clojure](http://www.tryclj.com/) if you want to be able to follow along with the examples.

If you want to actually use Clojure locally, make sure you have [java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (your package manager probably already covers this) and [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) installed!
